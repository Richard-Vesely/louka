# AGENTS.md: how this game is built, and the rules for AI helpers

You are helping kids (10–14) in an AI coding club change a browser game together. Talk to them in simple Czech,
explain what you change, keep changes small, and ask before big ones.

## The game in one minute

*Říše* (repository *rise*, formerly *louka*) is Marek's survival/building game in the browser (Three.js): endless terrain with
biomes, a voxel underground, trees, animals and night monsters, crafting (~260 recipes), cooking, farming,
furnaces, electricity, cars, a biplane, a computer with games and a printer, and the Mark dimension behind a portal.
The full feature list is [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md); read it before adding something.

There are **three ways to play, with one set of rules and one protocol**:

| Mode (menu button) | Who holds the world | Connection | Saved in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hrát sám** | this browser | none | `localStorage` (`rise-svet-v2`) |
| **Další možnosti → Vytvořit hru na svém počítači** | the host's browser tab (host = player `'host'`) | PeerJS code `LOUKA-XXXX` | host's `localStorage` (`rise-server-v1`) |
| **World buttons** (club server, `npm start`) | Node.js process, no player; one or more worlds (`WORLDS`) | WebSocket straight into the chosen world (+ password, asked once; + player name and PIN, asked once per device) | `DATA_DIR/<world>/world.json` + daily backups; player profiles in `DATA_DIR/players.json` |

Players who join a browser host by code keep their own backpack/position in their browser (`rise-klient-<code>`).
On the Node server every player has a **profile** (nickname + 4-digit PIN, server-wide, `server/profiles.js`), and the
backpack, armor, position and health live **on the server**, per profile and world (`players` inside that world's
`world.json`). The browser only remembers a login token per server address (`rise-hrac`). An old backpack from before
profiles (`rise-klient-<address>#<world id>`, the first world also `rise-klient-<address>`) is sent up once and then removed.

| Where | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `shared/data/items.js` | items (tools, armor, food, ingredients, utensils), basic recipes, stove cookbook `KITCHEN`, crops `CROPS`, campfire `COOKING`, block list `BLOCKS` |
| `shared/data/blocks.js` | building blocks: stones, stairs/slabs, biome blocks, glass, concrete and dyes |
| `shared/data/tech.js` | ores, furnace (`FURNACE_ONLY`, `FUEL`), workshop parts, engines, vehicles, computers, electric devices |
| `shared/data/costumes.js` | suits for *Můj oblek* (`SUITS`, colours, emblems), `cleanCostume`, the short text `encodeCostume` sent in the pose (`lk`) |
| `shared/data/index.js` | **import data from here**; finalizes recipes (grid pattern, category) once |
| `shared/world/terrain.js` | terrain height and biomes (its GLSL twin is `client/src/render/glsl.js`, keep them identical) |
| `shared/world/voxels.js` | the underground (what is where naturally, player edits, `setVox`, `groundHeight`) |
| `shared/world/state.js` | **the world state**: blocks, chests, fires, stoves, crops, furnaces, power, vehicles, papers… (`SyncMap` sends changes) |
| `shared/world/save.js` | `loadWorld(save)` / `worldState()` – the save shape used everywhere |
| `shared/world/nature.js`, `structures.js`, `collision.js` | trees, rocks, shards, ponds; structures and their builders; what is solid |
| `shared/sim/*.js` | simulations: `day.js`, `mobs.js` (AI, spawning, spawners), `ground-items.js`, `machines.js` (campfire, furnace, stove, crops), `power.js` (grid, printer), `weather.js` (rain, storm, fog from the day number and time: the same for every player, never sent) |
| `shared/net/net.js` | the `NET` object the rules talk to (mode, `op()` for world changes, hooks) |
| `shared/net/ops.js` | applying world changes from others (`applyOp`), small maps diff (`kvDiff`, `applyKV`) |
| `shared/net/room.js` | **the host**: accepts players, handles their messages, broadcasts (browser host and Node server) |
| `shared/events.js` | events from rules to the browser (`emit('mobHit', m)` → sparks and sound) |
| `shared/tools.js` | tools and combat rules: durability and wear, mining speed, attack charge and crits, repair in the crafting grid |
| `client/src/main.js` | entry point: menu, then the game modules |
| `client/src/menu/` | main menu (world buttons first from `GET /worlds`, then *Hrát sám*, then *Nastavení · Další možnosti*; club password asked once; player name + PIN asked once per device, then "Hraješ jako X · Změnit hráče"; *Další možnosti*: host in the browser / join by code) and settings |
| `client/src/game/` | boot (`NET` setup), prefs, save/load in the browser, the frame loop `loop.js` (`tick`), `debug.js` (`window.game`) |
| `client/src/render/` | renderer, sky, textures, icons, ground, grass, forest, blocks, underground meshes, particles, held item + first-person suit hand, day/night colours; `character.js` = the suit model, armor plates and animation (no side effects, the menu uses it too); the graphics look and what each Grafika tier turns on (`look.js`), post-processing (`post.js`), shadows, clouds, water, weather, embers/smoke (`ambient-fx.js`). Grafika Automaticky: `client/src/game/gpu.js` |

| `client/src/audio/` | all sound (WebAudio synthesis): `sound.js` mix + `Sound.at(x, y, z, fn)` positional sound, recipes in `sfx.js` / `voices.js`, materials, ambience, machine hums, music; `soundscape.js` runs it each frame |
| `client/src/ui/` | HUD, inventory window, touch controls |
| `client/src/machines/`, `pc/`, `vehicles/`, `dining/`, `world/` | the browser side of machines, the computer + Tanks + documents, car + plane, table manners, shrine/fishing/dropped items |
| `client/src/net/` | multiplayer in the browser: client side (`multiplayer.js`), avatars (other players, own body + third-person view, name tags), chat + Esc menu, the net loop (`mp-start.js`) |
| `server/` | `index.js` (env config), `worlds.js` (`WORLDS` list, moving old data), `server.js` (HTTP + WebSocket, logs players in, sends each player's messages to their world), `profiles.js` (player profiles: name + PIN, tokens, wrong-PIN throttle, `players.json`), `world-worker.js` (one world in its own thread: room + 20 Hz loop + saving + the players' backpacks), `me.js` (checks a player's state before it is saved), `sim.js` (one world step), `persist.js` (saving + backups), `admin-http.js` (`/admin` page + local admin port), `admin.js` (CLI: `players`, `reset-pin`), `static.js` |

## How it fits together

- **Rules vs. drawing.** Code in `shared/` changes the world and calls `emit('event', …)`; the browser listens with
  `on('event', …)` (`shared/events.js`) and draws sparks, plays sounds or rebuilds meshes. The server listens to nothing.
  Example: `hurtMob()` (shared) emits `mobHit`; `client/src/mobs/mobs.js` makes sparks and a sound.
- **World changes are sent automatically.** `blocks.set(k, 'planks')` on a `SyncMap` calls `NET.op(['m', 'blocks', k, v])`;
  the net loop sends collected ops. Small maps (chests, machines…) are compared as JSON and changed keys are sent.
- **Who simulates.** Whoever holds the world (single player, the host tab, the Node server) runs mobs, machines,
  power, day time. A joined player only shows what the host sends (`NET.client` is true there).
- **Browser modules run in a fixed order.** Marek's game was one big script; to keep it working exactly the same,
  every module in the chain first imports the previous one (the line with `// pořadí spouštění`), and `main.js`
  imports the last one. Order: `game/boot → game/prefs → game/save-load → render/renderer → render/sky →
  render/textures → render/icons → render/icons-blocks → world/papers → world/dig → render/icons-food → render/ground →
  render/grass → render/fireflies → world/world-state → render/forest → render/shards → world/shrine → render/blocks →
  render/vox-mesh → render/particles → audio/sound → player/inventory → ui/inventory-ui → machines/kitchen →
  machines/furnace → machines/power → pc/computer → pc/tanks → pc/printer → pc/papers-world → pc/doc-view → pc/editor →
  player/player → render/held-item → player/targeting → player/interaction → mobs/mobs → world/structures →
  render/dimension → world/ground-items → world/fishing → vehicles/car → vehicles/plane → player/eating →
  dining/dine-view → dining/food-models → dining/dining → player/survival → render/daylight → ui/hud → game/save →
  ui/touch → game/loop → net/multiplayer → net/avatars → net/mp-ui → net/mp-start → game/debug`.
  A **new browser module** either has no side effects at load time (only functions/constants; then no chain line
  is needed), or it gets a chain line and is inserted into the chain (check that `npm test` and the play-tests still pass). Modules in `shared/` never import `client/`.
- **`window.game`** (`client/src/game/debug.js`) exposes the game for the console and the play-tests. Keep it working.

## Protocol

Messages are arrays, the same over PeerJS and WebSocket (JSON). Host = `shared/net/room.js`, client = `client/src/net/multiplayer.js`.

- Client → host: `['ops', creative, ops]`, `['kv', changes]` (5×/s), `['pose', pose]` (12×/s; optional fields `lk` = the suit as
  `suit.colour.light.visor.emblem`, e.g. `'pilot.9.0.1.4'`, and `sn: 1` while sneaking; the host passes the pose on unchanged), `['pk', gid]` pick up,
  `['hit', nid, dmg, yaw, kb?]` (kb = knockback 0–2, default 1), `['mu', nid]` eggs/milk, `['print', key, paperId, copies]`, `['giveTo', pid, docId]`, `['chat', text]`.
- Host → client: `['welcome', { pid, name, perm, world, spawn, max }]`, `['full']`, `['join'|'leave', name]`, `['ops', ops]`,
  `['kv', changes]` (2×/s), `['pl', [[pid, name, pose, perm]…]]` (12×/s), `['mobs', dayTime, day, [[nid, type, x, y, z, ry, hp, flash, dead, eggs, milk]…]]` (5×/s),
  `['give', id, n, w?]` (w = tool wear), `['swap', from, to]`, `['dmg', n, dx, dz]`, `['perm', bool]`, `['toast', text]`, `['chat', name, text]`, `['gift', docId, from]`,
  `['kick', reason?]` (the browser host sends no reason; the Node server sends `['kick', 'Přihlásil ses jinde.']` when the same player logs in again in that world).
- Ops: `['m', 'blocks'|'blockMeta', key, value|null]`, `['s', 'removed'|'ruinsOpened', key]`, `['r', structure]`, `['v', x, y, z, id]`,
  `['c', x, z, r]` grass cut, `['p']` portal, `['g', gid, id, n, pos, vel, delay, w?]` dropped item (w = tool wear, only for worn tools), `['gx', gid, n]`.
- WebSocket only (Node server, `server/server.js`): the client first sends `['hello', { name, pass, v: 2, world, pin | token }]`.
  A wrong password gets `['denied', 'password']`. A known `world` id joins that world. A new client (`v: 2`) without
  a world or with an unknown one, on a server with several worlds, gets `['worlds', [{ id, name, creative, players, max }…]]`
  and can send `hello` again with a chosen `world`. An old client (no `v`) and every client on a
  one-world server join the first world. The welcome then also has `worldInfo: { id, name, creative, first }`
  (added by `server/world-worker.js`; the browser host doesn't send it). `GET /worlds` returns the same list over HTTP
  (no password, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`): the main menu shows a button per world from it and sends the
  chosen `world` in the first `hello` (the password comes from `localStorage` `rise-heslo`, per server address).
- **Player profiles** (Node server only, `server/profiles.js`): after the password and the world, the hello must carry the
  nickname plus either a 4-digit `pin` or a remembered `token`. New name + PIN creates a profile; existing name + right
  PIN or a valid token logs in. On a PIN login the server first sends `['token', t]` (the browser stores `{ name, token }`
  per server address in `rise-hrac`; the server keeps only SHA-256 hashes, last 5 per profile). Refusals:
  `['denied', reason, { text, wait, left, exists }]` with reason `'needpin'` (no PIN/token; `exists` = name taken),
  `'pin'` (wrong PIN; `left` tries), `'wait'` (5 wrong PINs per name + IP: wait `wait` s), `'badpin'` (not 4 digits),
  `'name'` (2–16 characters, not *Hráč*; `text` says why), `'token'` (unknown token, e.g. after a PIN reset). The
  connection then closes; the client asks again. The same profile already in that world: the old connection gets
  `['kick', 'Přihlásil ses jinde.']` and is closed. The welcome also has `me`: that player's saved state in this world
  (`null` = first time; added by `server/world-worker.js`). The client sends `['me', { inv, armor, pos, yaw, hp, hunger,
  crafted, placedAny, creative, flying, flyT, look }]` every 10 s and when leaving (`look` = the suit object, optional, cleaned by
  `cleanCostume`; the newer of server and browser wins by its time `t`); the world thread checks it (`server/me.js`:
  ≤ 64 KB, 36 + 4 slots, known item ids; a slot is `{ id, n, w? }`, `w` = tool wear) and saves it in `world.json` → `players[profile id]`. The browser host ignores `me`.
- Each world of the Node server runs in its own `worker_threads` thread, because `shared/` keeps one world in module
  state. Rooms, chat and players are per world; there are no messages between worlds.
- Trust model (Marek's, kept for now): the host decides mobs, pick-ups, time and machines; players are trusted for
  their own position, backpack and world edits (on the Node server the backpack is stored there, but its content still
  comes from the player's browser). See [docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md).

## Rules for AI helpers

1. **Small pull requests.** One idea per PR. Never push to `main`; open a PR, CI must be green, then the kid merges it
   (no review or approval is required). Never force-push.
2. **All text in the game stays Czech.** Comments may be Czech (most are) or English.
3. **Data before engine.** A new item, block, recipe, cooking recipe or mob is mostly a data change in `shared/data/`
   or `shared/sim/mobs.js`. Add engine code only when data can't express it.
4. **Be extra careful with core files:** `shared/net/*`, `shared/world/state.js`, `shared/world/save.js`,
   `shared/world/voxels.js`, `shared/world/terrain.js` + `client/src/render/glsl.js` (twins), `shared/events.js`,
   `server/*`, `client/src/net/*`, `client/src/game/*`, `client/src/menu/*`, `client/src/main.js`, the module order chain,
   the save format or localStorage keys, and balance (damage, speeds, drop rates, recipe costs). Before changing them,
   tell the kid in simple Czech what could break, keep the change as small as possible, add or extend a test that covers
   it, and say in the PR description which core file changed and why. No approval is needed: a PR is merged as soon as
   CI is green, so the tests are the safety net.
5. **Never change the protocol on one side only.** Host (`shared/net/room.js`), client (`client/src/net/multiplayer.js`)
   and the docs above change in the same PR. Old saves must keep loading.
6. **Keep `shared/` free of DOM and Three.js** (`npm test` checks that every file imports in Node).
7. **Keep `window.game` working**; the play-tests use it.
8. Files stay under ~400 lines (data tables and model builders may be longer). Plain JavaScript ES modules with JSDoc,
   no TypeScript, no frameworks. Add a new dependency only when plain code can't do it, and say why in the PR.
9. When you add or change a feature, update [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md) in the same PR.
10. No secrets in the repo (the server password lives in an env file on the server). No personal data about the kids:
    a profile is a nickname + a hashed PIN, nothing else. Never log or store a PIN or a token in clear text.

## Check your change

```bash
npm install                     # once
npm run dev                     # the game: open http://localhost:5173 (Hrát sám)
npm test                        # unit tests + the Node server over WebSocket (fast)
npm run build                   # build into dist/
npm run playtest                # menu + single player in a real browser (50+ checks), then the inventory tricks (27 checks); needs the build
npm run test:server             # Node server + 2 browsers: join, edits, mobs, pickup, chat, restart; then player profiles (name + PIN, backpack on the server, admin page)
npm run test:worlds             # Node server with 2 worlds + 2 browsers: world buttons, password once, isolation, creative, saves per world
npm run test:peer               # browser host + browser client over PeerJS (needs internet)
npm start                       # the server on http://localhost:8787 (serves dist/)
npm run test:load               # 8 simulated players: server memory, CPU, time per world step
npm run test:load:worlds        # the same with 2 worlds × 4 players
```
Console helpers (single player or host): `game.addItem('iron', 5)`, `game.setTime(0.9)` (night),
`game.spawnMob('boar', x, z)`, `game.setCreative(true)`, `game.teleport(x, z)`.

## Recipes

### Add an item
1. In `shared/data/tech.js` (or the matching section in `items.js`) add it with the `item()` helper, e.g.
   `item('honey', 'Med', 'basic', ['bottle', '#e8a020'], { food: 15 });`
   Fields: `food`/`heal` = edible, `stack` = max per slot, `fly` = seconds of flying after eating.
2. The icon: `art: [shape, colour, second colour]` draws it automatically. Shapes are the keys of `S` in
   `client/src/render/icons-blocks.js` (`ore, crystal, blob, ingot, bottle, gear, chip, book, …`). Without `art`
   (or a hand-drawn icon in `client/src/render/icons*.js`) the game breaks when the item is shown.
3. Make it obtainable: a recipe, a furnace/campfire result, a stove dish, a mob drop or loot (`LOOT` in `shared/world/structures.js`).

### Add a crafting recipe
In `shared/data/tech.js`: `R('honey', 1, ['BB', 'BB'], { B: 'berries' });` (category comes from the item) or in
`items.js`: `RECIPES.push({ out: 'honey', n: 1, shape: ['BB', 'BB'], key: { B: 'berries' } })`.
Letters map to items, a space is an empty cell. Up to 2×2 works in the backpack, 3×3 needs a workbench,
`{ adv: true }` needs the workshop. **Append** new recipes: the order is the order in the recipe book.

### Add a cooking recipe
- Campfire / furnace (raw → cooked): `COOKING.raw_fish = 'fried_fish'` in `items.js` (furnace only: `FURNACE_ONLY` in `tech.js`).
- Stove dish: add to `KITCHEN` in `items.js`:
  `{ out: 'honey_cake', n: 2, in: { flour: 2, honey: 1 }, tools: ['bowl'], heat: true, time: 8, steps: 'Česky popiš postup.' }`
  (`tools` are not used up; `returns: { bucket: 1 }` gives back an empty bucket). Append at the end: saved stoves remember the index.

### Add a block
1. In `shared/data/blocks.js`, inside the biome section, add with the `block()` helper:
   `block('honey_block', 'Medový blok', { hard: 1, tool: 'shovel', tint: 0xe8a020 });` and a recipe with `recipe(...)`.
   `tint` = coloured like concrete: the texture, the 3D block and the icon come for free.
2. A block with its own texture: add a texture in `client/src/render/textures.js` (each pixel returns
   `[r, g, b, height, roughness, metal]`; height makes the relief), a material in `blockMats`
   (`client/src/render/blocks.js`), its family in `BLOCK_PBR` (`client/src/render/materials.js`: stone, wood, brick,
   metal, glass…) and a first icon in `client/src/render/icons-blocks.js` (a 3D icon is then drawn automatically).
3. A special model (like the campfire): `special: true` in the block and a branch in `buildSpecial()` in `client/src/render/blocks.js`.
   `light: 10` makes it shine (and keeps shadow-eaters away).

### Add a mob
1. `shared/sim/mobs.js`: add to `MOBS`, e.g. `fox: { name: 'Liška', hp: 6, radius: 0.6, cy: 0.5, drops: [['raw_meat', 1, 1]] }`.
2. Where it appears: a line in `updateSpawns()` (copy the deer line and change the counts). Hostile? add it to the
   `hostile` condition and `HOSTILE_SPEED`; shy? to the flee lists. These are core rules: see rule 4 above.
3. Model: a new branch in `buildMob()` in `client/src/mobs/mobs.js` (copy the sheep and change colours);
   a sound in the `on('mobSound', …)` table there.

## What not to do
- Don't edit `legacy/` (Marek's original), `dist/` (built output) or `server/data/` (the live world).
- Don't add a free-text field that collects personal data. Names are nicknames only.
- Don't remove features from [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md). Fix or improve them instead; if one really has to go, say so in the PR.
